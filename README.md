versioning. that is, the left-most non-zero component denotes a
breaking change, instead of every version starting with a zero being
incompatible.

## licensing
this repository contains a mixture of different licenses, organized
following the REUSE specification. you agree for any contributions
intentionally submitted by you for inclusion into this repository to
be redistributed under the license(s) indicated by REUSE.
